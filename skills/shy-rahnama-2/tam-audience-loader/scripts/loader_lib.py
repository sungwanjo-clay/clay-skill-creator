"""Everything the loader decides without talking to Clay.

Reading a CSV, a TSV or one tab of an Excel workbook, inferring a type per column, minting a row key, deciding which of Clay's fixed
match keys a row can use, counting what cannot load, building one run's payload, and folding a
ledger back into a work set. None of it needs Clay, a network or a credential, which is why the
test suite can cover the parts that otherwise only fail on row 4,000 of a live load.

    python3 loader_lib.py sheets  --companies <book.xlsx>              # what tabs are in there
    python3 loader_lib.py inspect --companies <file[#tab]> [--contacts <file[#tab]>]
    python3 loader_lib.py check   --companies <file[#tab]> [--contacts <file[#tab]>] --map <map.json>

`inspect` proposes a mapping. `check` scores a confirmed one and prints the coverage report that
the gate is built on. Both are read-only and free.
