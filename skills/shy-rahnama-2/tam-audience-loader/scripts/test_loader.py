"""Exercise everything the loader decides, without Clay, a network or a credential.

    python3 test_loader.py

A graph that builds perfectly and dies on every row is the failure this catches. Two classes of
bug live here and neither shows up until a live load is underway:

  - a payload that carries a blank where Clay requires a value — which fails the node before it
    runs, or, for the company association, writes NO RECORD AT ALL while reporting a step status
    indistinguishable from a network blip;
  - a ledger fold that loses or re-fires rows, which on a ten thousand row load means duplicates
    nobody can take back.

Exit 0 means the decisions the loader would make are sound. It says nothing about whether Clay
accepted them — that is what Step 6's ten-row batch and Step 8's verification are for.
