# Email triage — classifier semantics, the enum, and the blocklists

## The classifier: what `extract-email-components` actually tells you (verified live)

Free (bills 0 credits + 0 action executions). Returns: `domain`,
`isLikelyCompanyEmail` / `isLikelyPersonalEmail` / `isLikelyEducationEmail`, the mail
provider, and `guessedName` parsed from the local-part.

- **personal / education detection is reliable** (known freemail providers, `.edu`).
- **`isLikelyCompanyEmail` is a RESIDUAL class** — it means "not a known freemail/edu".
  Disposable providers and NONEXISTENT domains both come back `company: true`. Treat it
  as "company candidate", never "real employer".
- **Role local-parts get no flag** — `info@`, `support@`, `test@` pass through
  unmarked. The generic screen below is your job.
- **`guessedName` is a hint, never an identity** — it capitalizes bare handles into
  name-shaped strings ("Kc Builds"). A search input later, never a result.
- The ad-hoc action surface is quota-capped (~25 test-runs/day per WORKSPACE, shared);
  fine for spot checks — run real batches as a table column or workflow node.

## Your deterministic screens (run on top of the classifier, still free)

1. **Generic-mailbox blocklist** — production builds run ~40 local-part tokens, wider
   than the handful usually quoted: `admin, info, contact, support, sales, hello,
   office, team, billing, hr, press, marketing, careers, jobs, help, service, admissions,
   accounts, finance, legal, security, abuse, postmaster, webmaster, noreply, no-reply,
   donotreply, mail, mailer, newsletter, notifications, alerts, dev, test, demo, root,
   sysadmin, it, ops, orders, enquiries, feedback` (match the local-part before any
   `+tag`, case-insensitive). Hit → enum `generic`.
2. **Disposable-provider list** — mailinator, guerrillamail, yopmail, 10minutemail,
   temp-mail and kin → enum `junk`. These are honeypot-adjacent; never spend on them.
3. **Freemail-typo screen** — a domain within edit-distance 1 of a major freemail
   domain, or a known typosquat (gmial.com, gamil.com, gmali.com, gmail.co, yahooo.com,
   hotmial.com, outlok.com, …), is a mistyped PERSONAL address, not a company: the
   classifier's residual "company" class will happily bless it, and typosquat domains
   are spam-trap territory. Classify `personal` with a `typo-domain` flag (no company
   candidate, no identity anchor, never spend); surface the flag so the user can chase
   the corrected address.
4. **Malformed / no-email** — fails basic RFC shape or the email cell is empty → enum
   `junk` / `no-email`.
5. **Vanity-domain caveat** — when the domain's registrable label ≈ the person's own
   name tokens (jordan@jordanlee…), the "company" is usually the person: treat the
   domain as a personal brand, not an employer anchor — identity may still resolve, but
   don't count the domain as a company signal on its own.
4. **(Optional) dead-domain screen** — a free MX check (any DNS tool; never hardcode a
   DoH URL) on unique domains kills spend on domains that can't receive mail: NXDOMAIN
   or no MX → dead; null MX (`0 .`) → declares no-mail; real MX → proceed.

## The Input Email Type enum

The routing key every downstream step gates on. One distinction to keep straight:
**`junk` is a routing verdict, not an address class.** A work-shaped address at a dead
or nonexistent domain is still a work-TYPE address — one that can't receive mail. Keep
the two facts separate (type: work; liveness: dead → route junk, spend nothing);
"disposable" means a disposable PROVIDER, never "any domain that won't resolve".
Conflating them corrupts both the routing evidence and any downstream segment stats.

Base tier (free, always):

| Value | Meaning | Downstream |
|---|---|---|
| `work` | company-candidate domain, person-shaped local-part | full path: identity → company → fit |
| `personal` | freemail | identity via email tie only; no company anchor; no company-anchored validation |
| `education` | `.edu`-class | the domain is the SCHOOL: identity corroborated via education history, employer comes from the identified person |
| `generic` | role mailbox | disqualify pre-spend ("mailbox, not a person") |
| `junk` | disposable / dead / malformed | disqualify pre-spend |
| `no-email` | empty cell | disqualify pre-spend |

Validated tier (optional, ~0.1 credits/row when the user wants sendable addresses):
fuse a deliverability verdict into the enum — `valid` / `valid-personal` /
`valid-edu` / `valid-catch-all` / `catch-all` / `invalid` (the production ~8-value
shape). Two traps: a validator's `valid` on a freemail address is deliverability, not
identity or policy — never read it as a segment pass; and catch-all is a per-validator
verdict — stay inside one validator's vocabulary. Rows you didn't validate carry
`validity: unverified` — an honest flag; absence of validation never gates a row out
(gate only on positive invalidity evidence).

## Verified failure shapes to gate on

- **Completion is not data** — `status: complete` wrapping `result: {}` is the routine
  miss shape, at run level AND item level (a complete run can wrap a failed item).
  Gate every verdict on the presence of an actual value.
- **Misses return in seconds** on single-lookup enrichments — fast+empty is the normal
  not-found path, not an error.
- **Headcount is a band string** ("1,001-5,000 employees") — parse bands or compare
  ordinals; `parseInt` silently yields 1 and `Number()` NaN, both of which flow through
  comparisons as false. Unparseable → `unresolved`, visibly.
