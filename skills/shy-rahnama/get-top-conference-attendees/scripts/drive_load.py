"""Run a conference campaign and load its dossiers into Audiences — and top it up later.

    python3 drive_load.py conference-config.json account
    python3 drive_load.py conference-config.json run   --conference "INBOUND" [--city X] [--year 2026]
                                                       [--conference-url https://www.example.com/the-event]
    python3 drive_load.py conference-config.json load   --campaign <campaign id>
    python3 drive_load.py conference-config.json status --campaign <campaign id>

`load` IS the top-up. There is no separate command and no "since" argument, because there is
nothing to be since: unlocking a dossier happens in a browser against the share link, with no
webhook, no unlock endpoint and no changed-since parameter anywhere in the API. Nothing can
tell this script what a person unlocked. So every load re-reads the whole campaign, takes
everything that now carries a dossier, subtracts what the ledger says is already written, and
writes the difference. Run it the day you start and run it again after somebody unlocks forty
more; the command is identical and the second run writes only the forty.

Resumability: every verdict is appended to the ledger THE MOMENT it settles, and the
remaining work is recomputed from the ledger rather than held in memory. Only a written
record settles — a failure stays in the work set so a retry picks it up untouched. And
because every write is an upsert keyed on the attendee's own identifier, a lost ledger costs
redundant writes, never duplicates.

The API key is read from the environment (or a file of KEY=value lines). It is never passed
as an argument: a key on a command line is visible in `ps` to every process on the machine.
