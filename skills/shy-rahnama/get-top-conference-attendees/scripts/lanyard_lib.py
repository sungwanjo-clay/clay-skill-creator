"""Read a conference campaign from the attendee-research API and reshape it for Audiences.

Every function below the client is pure: it takes a decoded response and returns plain data,
so the whole reshaping layer is exercised by `test_offline.py` with no network and no key.

Two rules this module exists to enforce.

1. **Scan candidate paths; never pin one.** The service documents two response envelopes for
   the same endpoint and its own spec does not describe every block its runtime returns. A
   pinned path that moves resolves to `None`, and a missing value is indistinguishable from a
   contact who genuinely has none. So every read walks a list of places the value is known to
   live and records WHICH one answered.

2. **Distinguish every reason a value is absent.** `enriched` / `ranked_only` / `queued` /
   `failed` / `unranked` are five different facts about a contact, and collapsing them makes
   every downstream rate meaningless. (There is no `locked` state: locked is not something a
   contact reports about itself — it is what `ranked_only` looks like from outside.)
