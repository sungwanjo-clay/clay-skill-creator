description: |
  Produce a copy-ready clause about a role a company is currently hiring for, selected by language
  the sender cares about — "cold call", "outbound prospecting", "Salesforce" — so the angle is
  "you're hiring for this and that is exactly what we do". Emits a freshness-gated clause that
  blanks when the only posting is stale, plus the evidence URL and posted date. Use whenever someone
  asks: they're hiring, who is hiring SDRs, companies hiring for X, find the hiring signal, what
  roles are they hiring for, or the job description mentions. Do NOT use it as a headcount or
  growth-rate signal, to build a market-wide list of every company hiring (that is a different
  endpoint and a different job), or as proof a role is still open — nothing here can know that. It
  writes its own output columns and sends nothing.

# Job posting language signal (filter server-side, or you will conclude the signal does not exist)

**The single most important thing here is a measurement, and it will save someone a week.** Most
jobs APIs return a title, a date, a URL and a summary per posting — **but never the full job
description.** The description is only reachable *through the filter*. Measured on the same 8
companies with the same 8 keywords:

| Approach | Companies matched |
|---|---|
| scanning the **returned fields** locally | **1 of 8** |
| the identical keyword set passed to the **description filter** | **5 of 8** |

**If you scan locally you will conclude the signal does not exist in your market.** It does. You
just cannot see it from the fields you got back.

**The second thing worth knowing: nothing here can tell you a role is still open.** A posted date is
when the provider *observed* the posting, not proof the job is live. So the clause bound into copy is
suppressed past 30 days — a blunt proxy that kills some genuinely open roles on purpose. Step 4
explains what that costs, with the numbers.

## Declared inputs

**Nothing here ships with a value.** Each one is the installer's, not the author's: ask for it,
never substitute a plausible default, and where an answer does not exist say which step becomes
unavailable rather than guessing.

| Input | What the installer supplies | If it is missing |
|---|---|---|
| **The rows** | a table, CSV or audience with a bare lowercase `company_domain` per row | no default |
| **`company_name`** | the company column | **required** — the mandatory name-match gate in Step 3 needs it. Without it, a posting from the wrong company can ship as this company's |
| **The keyword set** | the phrases whose presence in a job description makes the row interesting | **ask, set once per campaign, not per row.** And **enumerate the plural and gerund forms yourself** — see Step 2. There is no sensible default: the phrases are the sender's offer |
| **`role_titles`** | title filters, if they want to narrow further | not required. Description language is the signal; titles are a secondary narrowing |
| **Detection window** | how far back to look for a posting | default **60 days** to detect |
| **Copy window** | how fresh a posting must be to appear in a sentence | default **30 days**, and this is the one bound into copy. Loosening it is what ships a clause about a role that closed |
| **Whether this is a hiring-only segment** | whether rows with no posting should be excluded | default: **keep them and drop the clause.** If they want hiring-only, exclude **at list-build time, never at send time** |
| **The jobs data source** | the connected account their workspace uses | ask. Without it there is no evidence and this skill does not run |
| **Which model writes the clause** | the model configured in their workspace | a **non-reasoning** model. See Step 3: reasoning budget burn produces empty content on exactly the rows that had postings |

## What this skill touches

- **Reads** — the domain and company name on each row, and the company profile and job postings your
  jobs source returns for them.
- **Writes** — six of its own output columns: the freshness-gated clause, the ungated clause, the
  role named, the evidence URL, the posted date and a confidence flag.
- **Never** — claims a role is still open, quotes a raw requisition title into copy, uses a posting
  from a company whose name did not match, drafts or sends a message, enrols anyone, or writes to a
  CRM.
- **Halts** — Step 2 other, Step 4 sample-review.
- **Derived from** — the author's graded 8-company live test, plus phrase-recall counts measured
  across a whole jobs index over a 30-day window. The graded path is a script calling a jobs API and
  a model API; see the claims section.

## Declared outputs

| Field | Type | Example | Bind into copy? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `job_posting_line_safe` | string, ≤90 chars, freshness-gated | `you're hiring an account executive for private equity` | **yes — this is the only one** |
| `job_posting_line` | string, **ungated** | same text, regardless of age | **no — audit and debugging only, never in a send** |
| `job_role_named` | string | `account executive for private equity` | no |
| `job_evidence_url` | string | the posting URL | no |
| `job_posted_date` | date | — | no |
| `job_confidence` | `high` / `low` | `high` | no |

**Bind copy to the gated field. Building the table without the gate rebuilds the one failure in the
live test** — a clause quoting a 53-day-old posting for a role that had already gone from the
company's own board.

## Step 0 — Check the platform, and say where the work runs

Confirm the workspace is reachable, the jobs source is connected, and the table exists. Name them,
then say what this run touches: *"this adds six columns to <the table you named>, reads job postings
per domain, and sends nothing."* If a check fails, name it and stop.

**Send a browser user agent.** Several of these APIs sit behind a CDN that rejects default runtime
agents while allowing an ordinary command-line client.

## Step 1 — Build the keyword set, and enumerate the forms yourself

Description filters typically match **whole phrase tokens**, case-insensitively — no substring, no
stemming. Measured over one 30-day window of a whole jobs index:

| Phrase | Matches |
|---|---|
| `cold call` | 996 |
| `cold calling` | 2,065 |
| `cold outreach` | 2,339 |
| `outbound prospecting` | 2,796 |
| `cold email` | 1,877 |
| `coldcall` | **0** |

**`cold call` matching fewer postings than `cold calling` is the proof.** Under substring matching
the shorter phrase would be the larger set. It is not, so you must write out the plurals and the
gerunds. A 5-phrase set reached **59.8% recall** where an 8-phrase set reached **67.4%**.

**Do not reach for a classifier before you have measured recall.** Run the counts first. **Under 60%
recall means the keywords are wrong, and a model will not save them.**

## Step 2 — Filter server-side, and check that the filter did anything

Resolve the domain to a company profile, then request its postings **with the keyword set passed to
the description filter** and the detection window inside the date field.

**Unknown keys are silently stripped, and you get an unfiltered result set that looks successful.**
So before trusting any filter: **compare the result counts with and without it.** If a filter appears
to do nothing, the key is misspelled.

**Halt here (`other`).** Report the with-and-without counts for the keyword filter, so the installer
can see it is actually filtering rather than returning everything.

**A market-wide jobs search endpoint is a different thing.** It typically has no company-domain
filter at all, so it cannot answer "does this one domain have a posting". Use it for discovery —
pull every posting matching your filters, paginate, and join back to a TAM on the company
identifier. That is list building, not this skill.

**No cache, by decision.** The winning path is two free calls plus a cheap line write, so re-hit the
source every run. If a big list feels expensive, **dedupe the input on bare domain for that run**
instead of caching.

## Step 3 — Name-match, then write the clause

**The name-match gate is mandatory and runs on every row.** Compare the company name your jobs source
returned against the company name on your row, before using any posting from it. Domain-to-profile
resolution lands on the wrong company often enough that without this gate a clause can quote another
company's job.

Then the model rewrites the title into copy. **That rewrite is the only thing the model step exists
for**, and it is why raw titles cannot be used directly:

```
Partner Development Representative | Advisory and Services
  ->  a partner development representative
```

Rules the clause follows:

- Starts with the word **"you"**, lowercase, no trailing period.
- **12 words or fewer**, plain language, no em dashes.
- No requisition codes, no pipes, no bracketed location suffixes.
- It must read grammatically inside `Saw <clause>.` — **test every generated value in that exact
  frame.**

**There is nothing for the model to fabricate here**: it quotes a title from a payload it was handed
and returns the source URL. The live test confirmed it — **every evidence URL grepped back to the raw
source verbatim, zero inventions.** That is why there is no verifier pass on the claim.

**Empty content with a length finish reason is a retry, never an abstain.** Watch for a specific
trap: reasoning budget burn produces empty content **on exactly the rows that had postings**, while
rows with nothing to say succeed — **so the abstains look perfectly healthy while the signal
silently disappears.** Use a non-reasoning model, or low effort with a generous cap. Transport
errors get their own retry with backoff; they are not verdicts either.

## Step 4 — Apply the freshness gate, and know what it costs

Detect on 60 days. **Suppress the clause in copy when the posting is older than 30 days.** This is a
**formula, not a model call**, and the gated field is the one copy binds to.

**What that costs, measured on the live-test set: 2 of the 5 generating rows blanked.** One was 53
days old and correctly killed — the role was already gone from the company's own board. The other was
**49 days old and verified genuinely open**, and the gate kills it anyway.

**That second row is the price of a blunt proxy: a real open role, killed by its age.** A source that
exposes a true "is this still open" flag would keep it. The age proxy is what you have until one does.

**Halt here (`sample-review`).** Show 10 rows: the posting found, its date, whether the name-match
passed, the ungated clause and the gated one. Read them in the `Saw ___.` frame.

## Step 5 — Handle the blanks, and plan for the real rate

If the clause is empty, **keep the row and drop the clause.** Do not exclude the row unless the
sender asked for a hiring-only segment — and then exclude at list-build time, not at send time.

**This variable can never be mandatory in copy.** Expect roughly **60% of a healthy B2B software TAM
to produce a line before the freshness gate, and 35 to 40% after it.** Any row whose only posting is
31 to 60 days old blanks by design.

## Step 6 — Deliver

Report: rows with a posting, rows that passed the name-match, rows that generated a clause, and rows
the freshness gate suppressed — separately, with denominators. Name the gated field copy should bind
to, and say plainly that the ungated field is for audit only.

## Representative output

Invented examples for shape only; no real company or posting appears. Keyword set:
*cold call · cold calling · cold outreach · outbound prospecting · cold email · sales development ·
prospecting · SDR.*

### The clause, row by row

| domain | posting found | age | name match | `job_posting_line_safe` | what happened |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `northstar-example.com` | Account Executive, Private Equity \| Req 4417 | 6d | pass | `you're hiring an account executive for private equity` | requisition code stripped in the rewrite |
| `vantageloop.example` | Sales Development Representative (Remote - EMEA) | 18d | pass | `you're hiring sales development reps in EMEA` | bracketed suffix rewritten, not quoted |
| `meridian-example.com` | Partner Development Representative \| Advisory | 27d | pass | `you're hiring a partner development representative` | pipe and second clause dropped |
| `harborline.example` | Outbound Account Executive | **49d** | pass | `` | **gate suppressed it — and this role was verified genuinely open** |
| `pinegrove.example` | Enterprise AE | **53d** | pass | `` | gate suppressed it. Correctly — the role is gone from their board |
| `brightfold.example` | Senior SDR | 11d | **FAIL** | `` | profile resolved to a different company. Name-match gate stopped it |
| `atlas-example.com` | — | — | — | `` | no posting matching the keyword set. Correct abstain |
| `cedarworks.example` | — | — | — | `` | no posting at all in the window. Correct abstain |

### The run summary

```
8 companies
   7 usable (87.5%)   5 generated a clause, 3 abstained -- all 3 abstains correct
   1 failure          quoted a 53-day-old posting that was no longer live
                      ^ this is the failure the freshness gate now prevents

keyword filter, server-side vs local scan on these same 8 companies:
   filtered server-side  5 of 8 matched
   scanned locally       1 of 8 matched      <- do not scan locally

freshness gate:  2 of the 5 generating rows suppressed
   53d  correctly killed -- role gone from the company board
   49d  killed anyway -- VERIFIED still open. the cost of an age proxy

name-match gate: stopped 1 row using another company's posting

copy binds to: job_posting_line_safe   (never job_posting_line)
```

## What this skill does not claim

- **7 of 8 usable, and the honest breakdown matters more than the rate:** 5 rows generated a line, 3
  abstained, and **all three abstains were correct.** The single failure quoted a 53-day-old posting
  that was no longer live — which is exactly what the freshness gate was added to prevent. Eight
  companies is enough to find that failure. It is not a market study.
- **Nothing here knows whether a role is still open.** A posted date is an observation date. The
  30-day gate is a proxy, and it is blunt in both directions: it correctly killed one dead role and
  **killed one verified-open role** on the same test set.
- **Plan on 35 to 40% coverage after the gate, not 60%.** Roughly 60% of a healthy B2B software TAM
  produces a line before the gate. Rows whose only posting is 31 to 60 days old blank by design, so
  **this variable cannot be mandatory in copy.**
- **Recall depends entirely on the phrase set the installer wrote.** Measured: 59.8% on five phrases
  against 67.4% on eight, over the same window. A thin phrase set is not a signal that the market is
  quiet.
- **The phrase counts come from one index over one 30-day window.** They prove phrase-token matching
  rather than substring matching, which is the point; they are not a forecast of anyone's market.
- **The verdict covers a script path** calling a jobs API and a model API. **The in-platform build has
  never been run.**
- **This is not a headcount or growth signal.** One open req is not expansion, and the count of
  postings here is the count that matched a phrase filter, not the company's real hiring volume.
- **No reply, meeting or conversion rate is claimed**, and no benchmark for one exists here.

## What good looks like

- The keyword filter was verified to be filtering — counts compared with and without it — before
  anyone trusted a result.
- The phrase set includes plurals and gerunds, and someone measured recall before proposing a
  classifier.
- Nobody scanned returned fields for description language.
- Copy binds to the gated field, and the ungated field exists only in the audit view.
- The suppressed-by-freshness count is reported separately from the no-posting count. They are
  different things.
- The name-match gate fired at least once on a list of any size.
- Every clause reads correctly inside `Saw ___.` and none contains a requisition code or a pipe.
- The abstain count looks plausible *and* someone checked that rows which had postings produced
  clauses — the reasoning-burn failure makes healthy abstains out of lost signal.

## Rules

1. **Filter server-side. Never scan returned fields for description language.** 1 of 8 against 5 of 8
   on identical keywords.
2. **Bind copy to the freshness-gated field, never the raw one.**
3. **The name-match gate runs on every row** whose posting came from a domain-to-profile resolution.
4. **Never claim a role is still open.** The date is an observation, and the gate is a proxy.
5. **Enumerate plural and gerund forms yourself.** Matching is by whole phrase token, not substring.
6. **Measure recall before reaching for a classifier.** Under 60% means the keywords are wrong.
7. **Compare counts with and without a filter before trusting it.** Unknown keys are stripped
   silently.
8. **Raw job titles are not copy.** No requisition codes, no pipes, no bracketed suffixes.
9. **Test every generated value inside the exact frame it will render in.**
10. **A length finish reason is a retry, never an abstain** — and watch for reasoning burn, which
    empties exactly the rows that had signal while the abstains look healthy.
11. **Send a browser user agent.**
12. **No cache.** Dedupe the input on bare domain instead.
13. **Exclude non-hiring rows at list-build time, never at send time.**
14. **This skill writes its own columns and sends nothing.**
