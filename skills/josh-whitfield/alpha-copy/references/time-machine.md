# Time Machine: make the change the opening

Select `comparison_mode=before_after` to require a verified comparison. The opening must
state **both what was true earlier and what is true in the current observation**. For example,
with fictional evidence: “You used to lead with standalone reporting; now you are emphasizing
reporting inside the CRM.” The next line explains why that might matter for the actual offer.
A current-state-only line fails review. This is evidence comparison, not a claim that the sender
has been watching the prospect.

## Setup once, compare per company

- Choose Offer or ICP, CTA, greeting and signature as usual.
- Choose **Before vs. now** (`comparison_mode=before_after`) or **Best supported signal** (`auto`).
- Optionally set `comparison_focus`, such as buyer emphasis, product positioning or pricing.
- Optionally set `comparison_as_of` to a past `YYYY-MM-DD` cutoff. Every selected historical
  receipt must match it. Leave blank when companies have different available history.
- Map **Past observation** to `past_observation_json` and **Current observation** to
  `current_observation_json`, or supply receipts through `evidence_json`.
- If the current receipt is blank, Claygent researches current evidence live. If the past
  receipt is missing, required comparison mode returns a research hold; it never invents history.

In the default installation the date input selects/checks imported evidence. For automatic
retrieval, use the optional Exa-key installation in `exa-connection.md`. Users store their own
key in a Clay encrypted HTTP header account, then the installer binds two native HTTP API
nodes explicitly to that connection. It requests history as of the selected cutoff and fresh
current contents. The base installation has no automatic fetch until that version is installed.
Exa documents historical retrieval at https://exa.ai/blog/exa-snapshot.

## Minimal receipt examples (fictional)

Past column:

```json
{"id":"example-before","provider":"exa_snapshot","url":"https://example.com/","observed_at":"2026-09-18T12:00:00Z","requested_as_of":"2026-06-01T00:00:00Z","text":"Standalone reporting for independent finance teams.","role":"past"}
```

Current column:

```json
{"id":"example-now","provider":"source_capture","url":"https://example.com/","observed_at":"2026-09-18T12:00:00Z","text":"Reporting inside your CRM with connected account data.","role":"current"}
```

Examples illustrate shape, not reusable real observations. Keep source text intact. Never
make a model invent receipts. An actual provider capture time may be supplied as `captured_at`;
omit it when unavailable. Exa current contents without a historical cutoff uses source_capture,
with provider provenance recorded separately. Labels do not authenticate an imported receipt.

## What the checks establish

Python checks exact receipt IDs, company domains, verbatim excerpts, real dates, past-before-current
ordering, matching selected cutoff and current freshness (seven days by default; configurable
1–30 via `max_current_age_days`). It rejects identical text and title-only history.
The separate Claygent audit checks equivalent page purpose, source meaning, meaningful difference,
identity and offer relevance. Both sides must contain supported claims. A new date alone is not a signal. For historical comparisons, timing strength assesses the asserted temporal contrast: valid past bound plus fresh current observation can support earlier/now; exact capture dates or a corroborated transition provide stronger timing evidence. A comparison score never establishes an exact change date.

The final copy critic requires both observations explicitly in the opening and faithful date
precision. A requested cutoff means a snapshot at or before that cutoff. It is **not** the
actual capture date or the date the company changed. Without a real capture date, use
“earlier/now” or “from/toward,” not an invented month or “last week.”

A change in positioning can justify “you are emphasizing X more.” It cannot by itself justify
“you launched X,” “you stopped offering Y,” or “your operations now require Z.” Implications stay
hypothetical. Missing/unchanged evidence returns a hold even if the numerical score is high.

An imported current receipt may support a comparison when the same page cannot be reopened,
provided identity, date, contents and audit support it and no accessed evidence contradicts it.
The evidence card labels this as operator-provided provenance and retains its observation date.
It is not independent authentication or fresh retrieval by the workflow.

## Outputs for review

`comparison_json` retains before/after claims, historical/current URLs, receipt IDs,
requested cutoff, actual capture date if known, current observation date and change kind.
Subject/body keep research mechanics out of the email. The evidence card remains available
for a reviewer to inspect. No supported difference means no comparison copy.
