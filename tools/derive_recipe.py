"""Adapter (a) recipe derivation — INDEPENDENT of the acceptance harness.

The harness has its own `derive_evidence_from_config`. This module deliberately does NOT
call it: if the converter and the grader share extraction code, agreement is tautological
and proves only that one function equals itself. Disagreement between two independent
implementations is the signal.

Reads config only, via RULE 0b's four-command allowlist, or from an exported payload.
Never reads a cell, never runs a column, never writes.

# `metaprompt` is the human-authored spec the compiler was fed, retained afterwards and NOT
# sent. They diverge routinely — and sometimes contradict: one REF table's URL-comparison
# column instructs "normalize, ignore http vs https" in its metaprompt and "judge the /in/
# slug, do NOT compare URL syntax" in its prompt. Those are different behaviours.
#
# The mechanical tell (not a guess): the compiled text interpolates real column references —
# `Clay.formatForAIPrompt({{f_…}})` — while the spec carries human placeholders (`{{prompt}}`).
#
# So decision facts come from the RULE binding only. Extracting from the union of bindings
# mixes live rules with dead ones and then demands the draft transcribe both, which converts
# stale config into a false blocking finding.
