"""Injection detection — the reference implementation.

    "Does this package instruct the reader to do something its author should not be asking?"

The patterns are NOT in this file. They live in `fixtures/injection_patterns.json`, loaded at
import, for a reason that was learned the expensive way: the first delivery of this pattern set was
a Markdown specification with the regexes inline, and the recipient could not use it — extracting
regexes from a rendered document mangles them, and a hand-transcribed regex drifts from the one
that was measured. **Prose is a lossy channel for code.** So the data is the contract and this file
is one consumer of it.

Same shape as `portability.py`, deliberately: that check is trustworthy because `conformance.json`
is the contract between its three callers, not because the code is well argued. An implementation
that passes the suite is conformant and nothing else counts as evidence.

TWO THINGS THAT MAKE THIS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER CHECK HERE

1. IT IS HEURISTIC AND IT BLOCKS. Every other check in this repo obeys "nothing heuristic ever
   blocks", with credential detection as the single exception. This is the second, and it earns it
   in a different currency: a published skill runs on other people's machines and the instruction it
   carries executes there. A missed injection harvests credentials from every installer; a false
   positive costs one round of review. The override (`resolution: waived`, with the redacted
   evidence shown) is what makes blocking defensible rather than absolute.

2. IT READS AN ADVERSARIAL ARTEFACT. The input is content designed to make a reader follow it. This
   module treats it as bytes and matches patterns; it never interprets, never summarises, and must
   never hand the content to a model as anything but data.
