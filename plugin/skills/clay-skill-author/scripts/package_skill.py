"""Package contract + deterministic manifest/ZIP export for a generated skill.

Scope discipline: this module implements the PACKAGE SHAPE only. Every content check —
workspace handles, dangling relative references, bare credentials, endpoints, stale action keys —
is delegated to `eval/validators/portability.py`, which already carries four things this would
otherwise reimplement and get wrong at least once:

  * fence masking, so a handle quoted inside a fenced example does not fire
  * URL span masking (1.4.0), so a URL containing digits is not read as a workspace id
  * severity classes, so heuristic evidence reports instead of blocking
  * system-failure separation with the attribution triple

A standalone re-implementation would reproduce at least one of those bugs. It already cost six
`built` skills a false BLOCK once.

DETERMINISM means **content-manifest equality**, not archive-byte equality:
same relative paths, same per-file SHA-256, manifest verification succeeds. Archive bytes are
*additionally* stable here because entry order and timestamps are deliberately normalized — but
the contract a caller may rely on is the manifest, because a ZIP's bytes depend on the writer's
compression library version and that is not something a creator's machine can be held to.

ZIP intake is server-side. This writes files and reads them back; it touches no service.

Usage:
  package_skill.py validate <dir> [--action-catalog <actions.json>]
  package_skill.py manifest <dir>
  package_skill.py zip      <dir> <out.zip>
  package_skill.py verify   <out.zip> [--manifest <manifest.json>]

# ── Failure contract, mirrored from the Clay plugin's `bin/clay` bootstrapper ─────────────
#
# That shim emits a JSON error envelope on stderr with a CATEGORICAL exit code on every failure
# path, explicitly so "an agent that branches on the first `clay` invocation sees the same shape
# the binary emits". Ours did the opposite: measured across four failure modes, every one exited
# 1, and three dumped a raw Python traceback. So "your package has a blocking defect", "this tool
# is broken", "you gave me a path that does not exist" and "that file is not a zip" were
# indistinguishable to the caller — and an agent cannot decide whether to fix the skill, fix the
# invocation, or stop.
#
# Codes follow the Clay CLI's own space where the meanings line up, so an agent already branching
# on Clay exit codes needs no new vocabulary:
#
#   0  ok                 clean
#   1  internal_error     THIS TOOL is broken or a dependency is missing. Not the creator's fault.
#   2  validation_error   the INVOCATION is wrong: no such directory, unreadable manifest, not a zip
#   4  blocked            the PACKAGE has blocking findings. Not an error — a verdict, and the one
#                         outcome a creator is expected to act on.
#
# BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE on purpose: 0 still means clean and every failure is still non-zero, so
# `if exit != 0` logic already published in VALIDATION.md keeps working. The codes only ADD the
# ability to tell the cases apart.
