  Tier a book of accounts with Clay — turn a raw account list plus your ICP definition
  into tuned, auditable tiers (1–4 or A–F) with every score decomposed into visible,
  editable weights. Use whenever someone asks: tier my accounts, score this account list
  against our ICP, which accounts deserve outbound spend, build an account scoring model,
  rank our target book for territory planning, or add fit tiers before a signal or
  outreach play. It uses a deterministic weight table for arithmetic with judgment only
  for meaning-level signals, gates paid enrichment behind a free pre-score, renormalizes
  sparse rows instead of papering over gaps, and ships the weight table so the user can
  re-tune without rebuilding. Do NOT use
  it to score and route INBOUND leads/people (score-inbound-leads), to classify whether a
  contact is a buyer (buyer-classification), to just fill missing firmographics
  (enrich-account-list), or to audit existing-customer health (account-health-audit).
  A tier never ships without its component scores.

# Account tier scoring

The insight: **a tier is a budget-allocation decision the user will need to re-tune, so
the deliverable is a visible weight table, not a number.** The most common scoring
antipattern is picking the wrong engine: prompting an AI to do weighted arithmetic (pay
per row for worse-than-formula math, byte-inexact, untunable), or cramming meaning-level
judgment ("is this really our vertical?") into brittle keyword terms. The split that
works: **deterministic math for everything countable, judgment only where meaning
lives** — and every judgment call writes down what it saw. The second antipattern is
scoring rows the data can't support: a missing dimension silently scored as 0 craters
good accounts for being under-enriched. Sparse rows get renormalized over the weights
actually observed; rows below the observability gate return "cannot tier," never a
confident middle grade.

## Step 0 — Verify Clay is working

Run `clay whoami; echo "exit_code=$?"`. If it fails or Clay tools are missing, run the
Clay plugin's `setup` skill, restart if it says to, and re-run this skill. Tell the user
which workspace you're in. **Where the work runs decides what it costs**, so state it
up front: the arithmetic and the judgment overlay run IN THIS AGENT — zero Clay credits,
no per-row charge — and that is the default this skill assumes. If the user wants the
overlay running as a Clay AI/Claygent column instead, it bills PER ROW and the
zero-credit claim no longer holds; price it before switching. Paid enrichment otherwise
enters only at Step 3's fill-in gate, via managed functions — find them with
`clay routines list`, then read each one's declared cost with `clay routines get`
(`estimatedCreditCost`; the list call does not carry costs) before promising fills.

## Step 1 — Collect the scoring definition (interview; do not guess)

1. **The book** — CSV, table, or Audience of accounts; minimum one domain column.
   Dedupe on normalized domain first (subsidiaries of one parent are ONE decision —
   ask how they want hierarchies treated).
2. **ICP dimensions and weights** — what makes an account tier-1 for THEM: industry /
   vertical, size band, geography, tech signals, funding stage, persona presence.
   Take their words, then propose a starting weight table (below) they approve. If they
   can't rank dimensions by importance, that conversation IS the deliverable — do it
   before any scoring.
3. **Tier semantics** — how many tiers, and what each UNLOCKS (tier 1 = named-account
   outbound; tier 2 = pooled; tier 3 = nurture; tier 4 = suppress). Tiers that don't
   gate an action are decoration; say so.
4. **Field inventory** — which scoring inputs already exist per row vs need enrichment.
   This drives Step 3's cost gate.

## Step 2 — Choose the engine (decision, stated to the user)

- **Weight-table formula (default)**: a sum of weighted terms over row fields,
  thresholded into tiers. Same input, same output, zero credits, and the user can
  re-tune any weight without you. Use when dimensions are countable facts (size band
  in range, geo match, signal present).
- **Judgment overlay (only where meaning lives)**: industry/vertical fit from a
  description, non-standard dimensions no provider measures (multi-brand status,
  regulatory exposure), tier-adjustment rules ("recent M&A bumps a letter"). Each
  judgment emits a score AND the evidence phrase it read. Never let judgment do the
  arithmetic — the weighted sum is the formula's job, byte-exact and free.
- **Hybrid (the production shape)**: formula makes the rough cut on the whole book;
  judgment refines only the top cohort. State the split ("formula on all N, judgment
  on the ~20% that clears tier-2") so cost and effort stay proportional. Three rules
  make the staging unambiguous:
  - The **rough cut is triage, not a delivered tier**. It ranks on the formula
    dimensions alone, purely to pick the judgment cohort; the observability gate and
    the final tier are NOT applied at this stage.
  - A judgment dimension whose sub-score was **never computed for a given row is
    UNOBSERVED for that row** — its weight leaves both sums and it appears in
    fields-missing. The input being present (the description exists) is not enough;
    only a computed sub-score counts as observed.
  - Therefore **hybrid is only available when the formula dimensions alone clear the
    gate** — `Σ(formula wᵢ) / Σ(all wᵢ) ≥ 0.50` — because non-cohort rows are tiered
    on those dimensions only. If judgment carries more than half the table's weight,
    say so and pick one: run judgment on every row, reweight, or lower the gate. Never
    silently deliver a book whose non-cohort rows are all cannot-tier.

## Step 3 — Pre-score gate, then fill only what's worth filling

Compute a **free pre-score from the fields already present** (domain exists and isn't a
free-mail provider; size band known; geo known). Only rows above the pre-score floor
earn paid enrichment for missing dimensions — this is the canonical credit-protection
move; state the arithmetic (rows × fills × declared cost) and get approval before any
paid call. Enrichment discipline for fills: gate on returned VALUES, not run status
(complete-with-empty is a miss, not data); size/revenue arrive as BAND STRINGS — compare
as bands, never parse to integers; enrichment presence is not liveness — a dead or
acquired company enriches fine on last-known data, so flag liveness doubts rather than
tiering them as healthy.

## Step 4 — Score with the weight table

Weight table (weights are the user's; these are the starting proposal, and they need
not sum to 100 once re-tuned):

```
dimension            weight wᵢ
  industry_fit          25   (judgment: description vs ICP verticals, evidence quoted)
  size_band_in_range    20   (compare the BAND field as a band — see below)
  geo_match             15
  tech_signal           15   (each corroborated signal counts once)
  funding_stage         10
  persona_presence      15   (target-function people found at the account)
```

Each dimension gets a sub-score **sᵢ on 0–1** (0 = fails the dimension, 1 = fully
satisfies it, fractions allowed for judgment terms). The composite is on **0–100**:

```
composite = 100 × Σ(wᵢ × sᵢ) / Σ(observed wᵢ)
```

Both sums run over OBSERVED dimensions only — the same set, so a fully-observed row's
composite equals its plain weighted sum. Rules, all mandatory:

- **"Observed" is a definition, not a judgment call.** A dimension is observed when its
  input is present: **not null/undefined, not an empty or whitespace-only string, and
  not a value outside the dimension's declared enum** (an unparseable size band is NOT
  an observed size). Critically, **`0`, `false`, `"0"`, and `"false"` ARE observed** —
  they are evidence the dimension FAILS, and they belong in both sums with sᵢ = 0.
  Never test presence by truthiness: that scores a row's failures as absences and
  inflates its composite.
- **Number-coerce every sᵢ and wᵢ before arithmetic** — CSV fields that look numeric
  are often strings; some engines concatenate instead of adding, others raise. Coerce
  first, and coerce only AFTER the observed test above (so `"0"` survives as observed).
- **Band-vs-number is per FIELD, not a blanket rule** (live-verified): enrichment
  payloads return `size` and revenue as BAND STRINGS ("10,001+ employees",
  "100B-1T") — compare those as bands, never parse them to integers. The SAME payload
  may also carry an exact integer headcount field; when it is present, use it for a
  numeric size test and say which field you used. Never invent a number from a band,
  and never discard an exact count because a sibling field is a band.
- **Sparse rows renormalize, they do not crater.** An unobserved dimension leaves BOTH
  sums; one missing dimension must not crater the composite.
- **Credibility guard** — a judgment sub-score of `cannot determine` means the
  dimension is **NOT observed**: its weight is removed from BOTH the numerator and the
  denominator before renormalization (identical treatment to an absent input), and it
  is listed in fields-missing. It is never scored as 0. If the judgment cannot assess
  the ENTITY at all, the row goes to cannot-tier regardless of the other dimensions.
- **Minimum-observability gate (weight-based, strict).** Let
  `observability = Σ(observed wᵢ) / Σ(all wᵢ in the approved table)`. When
  `observability < 0.50` the row is **"cannot tier — under-enriched"**: no composite,
  no tier, listed separately with its fields-missing. At exactly 0.50 the row IS
  tiered. The test is on WEIGHT only — never on how many dimensions are missing, and
  never approximate. **The gate and the tier are computed ONCE per row, at delivery,
  over the dimensions observed for THAT row** — after any judgment overlay has run on
  the rows it runs on (Step 2). A hybrid rough cut never produces a gate verdict.
- **Rounding.** Thresholds are exact cuts, so fix the precision: round each component
  and the composite to ONE decimal, half-up, and compare the rounded composite against
  the thresholds. (A 0.33 sub-score on a weight-15 dimension is 4.95 → 5.0, and a
  composite of 86.95 → 87.0.)
- **Thresholds are conventions** — propose (≥80 → T1, ≥50 → T2, ≥25 → T3, else T4),
  show the score distribution, let the user move the cuts. A distribution with 60% in
  tier 1 means weights need re-tuning, not that the book is great.
- **Thin rows carry their thinness.** Renormalization has no upper penalty, so a row
  observed at 55% weight that passes what it shows can outrank a fully-observed row
  that fails one dimension. Every delivered row therefore ships its `observability`
  and fields-missing next to the tier (Step 5) — a T1 off 60% of the weight table is
  a T1 with a caveat, and the user may raise the gate above 0.50 if they want the
  bar higher.

## Step 5 — Deliver the tunable artifact

Per account: `domain · tier · composite score · observability (observed weight / table
total) · every component score · evidence phrase for each judgment term · fields-missing
list · flags (cannot-tier / liveness-doubt / hierarchy-collapsed)`. Plus the weight
table itself, the observability gate, and the tier thresholds, stated so
the user can re-cut without you. Plus the distribution (accounts per tier) and the drop
ledger (dedupes, cannot-tiers, suppressed). Offer the standing version: re-score on a
cadence, and note that scores go stale — a tier computed before a funding round or
acquisition is the OLD company's tier.

## What good looks like

- The user can answer "why is this account tier 2?" from the row itself — component
  scores + evidence, no black box.
- Re-tuning is a weight edit, not a rebuild.
- "Cannot tier" rows are visible and counted — a book with zero of them usually means
  missing dimensions were silently zeroed or invented.
- The common mistake: one mega-judgment that outputs a letter grade per account with a
  paragraph of reasoning and no decomposition — unauditable, untunable, and it costs
  per row what the formula does for free.

## Rules

- MUST decompose every tier into visible component scores and ship the weight table;
  NEVER deliver a bare tier.
- MUST renormalize over observed weights on the stated 0–100 scale and route rows below
  the 0.50 observability gate to "cannot tier"; NEVER score an unobserved dimension as
  zero, and NEVER treat an observed `0`/`false` as unobserved.
- MUST keep arithmetic deterministic — judgment produces component scores and evidence,
  never the weighted sum.
- MUST gate paid fills behind the free pre-score and explicit cost approval; band
  strings compare as bands.
- NEVER tier on enrichment presence alone when liveness is in doubt, and NEVER write
  tiers into a CRM or trigger outreach — the tiered book is the deliverable.

## Worked example

Ask: "Tier our 400 target accounts; we sell compliance software to US fintech and
healthtech, 100–2,000 employees." Interview yields the weight table above with
persona_presence swapped for a compliance-team dimension. Dedupe: 400 → 371 unique
(29 subsidiary rows collapsed, per their parent-level decision). Pre-score on existing
fields: 84 rows below floor (no domain / consumer domains / geo mismatch) — excluded
from paid fills, listed. Fills approved for 61 rows missing size band (1 credit each,
stated, approved). Scoring: formula on 371; judgment overlay (industry fit + compliance
signals, evidence quoted) on the 112 that cleared tier-2. Distribution: 38 T1 / 74 T2 /
151 T3 / 89 T4 / 19 cannot-tier (under-enriched, listed with missing fields).

Three rows, arithmetic shown (weights: industry 25, size 20, geo 15, tech 15,
funding 10, compliance 15; table total 100):

- **Fully observed** — `meridianpay.example · T1 · 87 · observability 1.00 · industry
  25 (s=1.0, "payments infrastructure for banks") · size 20 (s=1.0, 201-500) · geo 15
  (s=1.0) · tech 12 (s=0.8) · funding 10 (s=1.0) · compliance 5 (s=0.33) · missing:
  none` → 100 × 87/100 = **87**.
- **Sparse, with an observed failure** — `kirivale.example · T2 · 58.3 ·
  observability 0.60 · industry 15 (s=0.6) · size 20 (s=1.0) · geo 0 (s=0.0 — US-only
  ICP, HQ is EU: observed and failing, so its 15 stays in BOTH sums) · missing: tech,
  funding, compliance` → 100 × 35/60 = **58.3**. Had geo been scored as absent instead
  of failing, this row would read 100 × 35/45 = 77.8 and land T2-high — the exact
  inflation the observed-definition prevents.
- **Judgment abstained** — `northfield.example · T1 · 83.3 · observability 0.60 ·
  industry — (cannot determine: description too thin; weight removed from both sums) ·
  size 20 (s=1.0) · geo 15 (s=1.0) · tech 15 (s=1.0) · funding 0 (s=0.0) · missing:
  industry_fit, compliance` → 100 × 50/60 = **83.3**.
- **Under-enriched** — a row observing only geo + funding has observability 0.25 <
  0.50 → **cannot tier**, no composite, listed with its missing fields.

User moves the T2 cut from 50 to 55 after seeing the distribution — a one-line change,
re-delivered in minutes.
