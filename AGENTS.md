# Working in this repository

This tree is the kit for authoring a Clay GTM skill and submitting it to the marketplace.
**`START-HERE.md` is the entry point**; this file only carries what an agent cannot infer from the
tree, and points at the pages that say the rest.

## If the `clay-skill-author` skill is already loaded, follow it and stop reading here

That skill IS this kit's procedure, and it is self-contained: it needs no clone and no network. When
it is available — installed as a plugin, or invoked by name — it is the authority on what happens
next, and re-deriving the steps from these files instead will produce a slower and worse version of
the same thing. Everything below is for the case where it is NOT loaded and you are working from the
tree directly.

## Three things worth knowing before writing a skill

- **One `SKILL.md` at the package root.** Supporting files go under `references/` or `scripts/`,
  and every one of them must be referenced from the body. `PACKAGE-LAYOUT.md` is the contract.
- **A skill has to run on someone else's machine.** No table ids, column ids, account handles or
  credentials in the body — those belong to whoever wrote it, not whoever installs it. Everything
  the installer supplies goes in a `## Declared inputs` table, with what happens when it is absent.
- **Nothing is sent without an explicit yes.** `tools/submit_skill.py` previews first and refuses to
  send without a token that only the preview mints, so a submission cannot happen as a side effect.

## Checking a package

    python3 tools/package_skill.py validate <package-dir>

`VALIDATION.md` says what each exit code means and which findings block. `DETERMINISM.md` covers
choosing between Clay functions when more than one would do the job, and
`references/functions/` carries what each surface actually returned — read its index, then the one
leaf for the job.

## Do not edit this tree

Your skill is its own package, written wherever you are working. Nothing you build belongs inside
these files, and an edit here does not travel with your submission.

## Where the worked examples are

`examples/` is a curated set of finished skills — the format demonstrated rather than described —
including a low-yield case: what an honest skill looks like when the source table did not hold
enough to convert. `skills/` holds skills other people have published; read them for reference, and
note they are their authors' work rather than part of this kit.
