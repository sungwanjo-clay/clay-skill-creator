  Resolve a company name to its single canonical operating-company domain with Clay —
  validated, evidence-backed, or an honest "ambiguous", "not found", or "acquired"
  flag with the candidates listed. Use whenever someone asks: find the domain for this company,
  resolve the real domains for these company names, clean this messy company list
  before enriching it, what is the actual website of X, which domain is the operating
  entity, or verify these domains belong to these companies. The keystone task: a
  wrong domain poisons every downstream enrichment, so this skill validates that
  the domain actually belongs to the operating company and refuses to guess on
  ambiguous names. Do NOT use it to enrich the resolved company
  (enrich-account-list / company-research-brief), to find people there
  (find-decision-makers-at-company), or to source new companies
  (build-prospect-list). Built on the managed Company Domain function as candidate
  generator, wrapped with free validation probes and ambiguity refusal.

# Resolve a company's domain

The insight: **a wrong domain poisons every row downstream — refusing beats
guessing.** The naive version takes the first search hit or whatever a lookup
returns; the failure is silent, and every enrichment, signal, and email built on it
inherits the wrong company. So this skill treats any looked-up domain as a
CANDIDATE, validates it actually belongs to the operating company (not a parent, a
brand redirect, or a similarly-named stranger), and returns `ambiguous` or
`not_found` — with candidates — when the name doesn't pin one entity. An honest
refusal costs a re-ask; a confident wrong domain costs the whole row, invisibly.

## Step 0 — Verify Clay is working

Run `clay whoami; echo "exit_code=$?"`. If it fails or Clay tools are missing, run
the Clay plugin's `setup` skill, restart if it says to, and re-run this skill. Tell
the user which workspace you're in. Confirm the managed **Company Domain** function
exists and read its declared cost (`clay routines list`, then `clay routines get
<id>` — `get` requires the routine id).

## Step 1 — Route by what you have

| You have | Path |
|---|---|
| Name + a claimed domain | validate the claim (Step 3) — no lookup spend |
| Name only | candidate lookup (Step 2) → validate |
| Domain only | validate (Step 3), entity name comes from the site |
| Neither, but a LinkedIn company URL | pull the site link from the profile → validate |

Batch input: dedupe names first; state cost (lookups × declared cost + ~0-1 credit
validation per survivor) and get approval before running.

## Step 2 — Candidate lookup (paid, name-only rows)

Run the managed **Company Domain** function (name → domain, ~1 credit). Its output
is a CANDIDATE, never a result — the function resolves *a* company for the name,
not necessarily *the* company (name collisions are the #1 failure), and lookups on
ambiguous or common-word names return confident wrong answers. Optional second
candidate source when hints exist (a known country/region, industry): the company
search arm — noting its identifier filter is recall-not-exact and can miss the
canonical entity entirely (gate on match confidence, never take position as truth).

## Step 3 — Validate the candidate (the lever; mostly free)

Run the ladder in `references/validation-ladder.md` — in order, cheap first:

1. **Normalize** (free, code): strip scheme/www/paths, registrable label
   (public-suffix aware).
2. **Liveness + redirect probe** (free): real HTTP status via the status-honest
   probe; NXDOMAIN/dead → `not_found` evidence; a redirect landing on social media
   or a parking page → inactive candidate; a redirect to ANOTHER domain → follow it
   and validate the destination (brand → corporate redirects are common).
3. **Site-content check** (~1 credit on survivors): fetch the homepage; the site
   must plausibly BE the company — name/brand present, business coherent with any
   hints. A parked/for-sale/soft-404 body fails (a scraper's SUCCESS is not
   page-existence).
4. **Operating-entity check**: is this the entity the user means — the operating
   company, not the holding parent or a regional clone? Name-boundary discipline
   applies ("X Partners"/"X Group" are different entities). **Acquisition is a
   verdict, not a pass**: if the evidence says the company was acquired or absorbed
   (site redirects to the acquirer, "now part of Y" content, acquirer branding),
   the old-name domain is NOT the canonical answer — return `acquired` with both
   the stale domain and the acquirer's domain named; a REBRAND of the same entity
   (same company, new name/site) may still resolve, with the reasoning stated.
   Enrichment corroboration when needed (~1 credit): the payload's `website` field
   (never its `domain` field, which can echo a link-shortener) — and remember
   enrichment PRESENCE proves the entity exists in data, never that the domain is
   alive: dead and acquired companies enrich fine on last-known data.

## Step 4 — Verdict (five values, no sixth)

- **resolved** — one candidate survived all gates → `canonical_domain` +
  `operating_entity_name` + `confidence` (validated / corroborated) + `provenance`
  (which gates it passed, quoting evidence).
- **acquired** — the named company was absorbed → the stale domain is never the
  answer; emit `acquired` + the acquirer's domain as the actionable candidate
  (resolving to the acquirer is a USER decision — the entity changed).
- **ambiguous** — the name pins multiple real entities → the candidate list with
  one line each; the USER picks. Common-word names land here by default.
- **not_found** — no living candidate → say what was tried.
- **mismatch** (claimed-domain path) — the claim failed validation → the evidence,
  plus the best candidate if one emerged.
Never a guessed domain asserted as fact; never "probably". Per-row provenance
always; batch output adds a summary (resolved / ambiguous / not_found / mismatch
counts, credits measured).

## What good looks like

- **Resolved rows are load-bearing** — downstream enrichment can key off them
  blindly; that's the whole point of the gates.
- **The ambiguous bucket has content on messy lists** — a 100% resolution rate on
  common-word names means the skill guessed; refusal IS the feature.
- **Provenance per row** — which gates passed, what the site showed; a domain
  without provenance is a rumor.
- **Free gates run first** — most candidates die (or pass) on normalization and the
  status probe before any credit is spent.
- The common mistake: treating the lookup function's answer as the answer. It
  resolves A company, confidently, every time — including for names that belong to
  three companies or none.

## Rules

- MUST treat every lookup output as a candidate; MUST run the validation ladder
  cheap-first; MUST follow redirects to the destination before judging.
- MUST refuse (ambiguous, with candidates) when the name doesn't pin one entity;
  MUST return not_found rather than a best guess when nothing survives.
- MUST read enrichment corroboration from `website`, never `domain`; MUST apply
  name-boundary discipline to candidate entities.
- NEVER assert an unvalidated domain, pattern-guess a domain from the company name,
  or let a parked page pass as an operating site.
- NEVER assert a stale old-name domain for an acquired company (the `acquired`
  verdict exists for exactly this); NEVER let enrichment presence stand in for
  liveness — dead companies enrich fine on last-known data; only the probe answers
  "is this domain alive".
- Batch: dedupe names first, state cost, cap the run; per-row provenance ships.

## Worked example

Ask: "Clean these 5 company names into real domains: Brightloop, Meridian, Subway,
Quartzlane Systems, Zzyqx Dynamics."
- **Brightloop** → lookup → brightloop.example → probe live, homepage says
  "Brightloop — workflow automation", entity matches → **resolved** (validated).
- **Meridian** → lookup returns a fintech's domain confidently — but the name pins
  a fintech, a consultancy, and a medical group → **ambiguous**, 3 candidates
  listed, user picks (the lookup's confidence changed nothing).
- **Subway** → subway.com resolves, but entity check notes it's the BRAND/franchise
  parent — flagged so the user confirms brand vs franchisee intent → **resolved
  (operating-entity note)**.
- **Quartzlane Systems** → lookup → a domain that redirects to
  quartzlane-holdings.example (a parent) → destination validated, holding-vs-
  operating flagged → **resolved (corroborated, entity note)**.
- **Zzyqx Dynamics** → lookup empty, no living candidate → **not_found** (tried:
  lookup, search, direct .com probe).
- Counter-case: "Loopwise" → lookup returns loopwise.example, which redirects to
  its acquirer's site ("Loopwise is now part of OrbitStack") → **acquired** — the
  stale domain is never asserted; the acquirer's domain ships as the candidate.
Summary: 3 resolved · 1 ambiguous · 1 not_found · ~4 credits measured (free gates
killed 60% of the paid validation).
